# Read only list: We can not modify and only read object
# Add a comma to make python turn it from a integer to a tuple
# When to use: When you need a list of items that should never change

# point = (1, 2) + (3, 4)

# print(point)

# list to tuple
# point = tuple([1,2])
# print(point)

# String to tuple
# point = tuple("Hello World")
# print(point)


# point = (1, 2, 3)
# print(point[:2])

# Spreading and searching
# x, y, z = point
# if 10 in point:
#     print("exists")

# Can't modify:
# point[0] = 10
